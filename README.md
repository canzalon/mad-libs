mad-libs
========

This program simulates the classic mad libs by filling in a story that has blanks requesting types of words (such as nouns, adjectives, pronouns, etc) with words from a provided text file of words (a dictionary). The program accepts this dictionary text file, as well as a text file containing the story with blanks to be filled in. The algorithm fills in words from the dictionary based on the type of word requested. A file with the filled-in version of the story is saved to the directory when execution is complete. The program utitlizes C++ vectors and encapsulation for the dictionary key-value pairs as "entry" objects/ADTs. It is designed procedurally, though it is designed in a fashion that would allow for easy transition into an OOP design.  Future versions may have functionality for users to input a story into the console or gui, rather than uploading a text file in the directory. There could also be functionality for explorer browser used to input file from hard drive. Functionality for entering requested blank words may be added as well.
